_**🚀 JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures Projects**_


Hey there! Welcome to my coding corner! After about 300 hours of diving into the JavaScript world, I’ve emerged with some neat projects that flex my newfound skills in algorithms and data structures.

🌟 What’s Inside
Check out these projects that show off my JavaScript prowess:

Palindrome Checker
Ever wondered if "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" is a palindrome? Now you can find out!

Roman Numeral Converter
Because sometimes, modern numbers just don’t cut it. Get ready to embrace your inner Roman!

🎉 Why I Made This
I believe that learning should be fun and engaging. These projects not only helped me master JavaScript fundamentals but also gave me a chance to get creative. Plus, who doesn't want to convert numbers to Roman numerals?
